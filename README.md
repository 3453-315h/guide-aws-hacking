# Fingerprinting

## AWS Acount ID Fingerprinting

Information about related account ids that belongs to the target organisation is not directly available. There are however, various techniques that can be used to obtain such information. This information can be subsequently used to find AWS account ids.

### Public Code Repositories

Public code repositories belonging to the target organisation could contain artifacts related to AWS accounts such as ARNs (Amazon Resource Names). [Gitleaks](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks) is a tool which comes extremely useful in such situations. In fact, OpenDevSecops official [Gitleaks Docker Build](https://github.com/opendevsecops/docker-gitleaks) contains prebuilt configuration files that can be used to enumerate AWS resources. Here is an example:

```sh
docker run opendevsecops/gitleaks --config=/run/configs/aws-enum.toml --github-org=target --exclude-forks -v
```

### Search Engines

Needless to say, the target organisation may already disclouse this information somewhere such as GitHub, Stackoverflow, etc. Some basic searches could produce fruitful results:

```
"arn:aws:" target
```
